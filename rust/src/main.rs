// - &          -> OK so `&` is how we indicate something is a _reference_ to a
//                 value of whatever type proceeds this (in this case `str`).
// - 'static    -> This is a *lifetime annotation*. These are used to tell the
//                 compiler where we're borrowing a something _from_. `static`
//                 is a special annotation that means a reference can live for
//                 the entire duration of the program. All string literals have
//                 this lifetime. The compiler doesn't seem to care if I don't
//                 include this, but I figured I'd add it anyway?
// - str        -> `str` is an immutable sequence of utf8 bytes. This separates
//                 it from `String` which is, uh, not that?
// - 19         -> Arrays are fixed-size in Rust, so we need to encode that size
//                 in the type.
